(* TASK 1 *)

// You've learned or seen all of the following: 
//   1. let let let let (function definitions and values)
//   2. match for pattern matching and strings
//   3. dot notation. F# supports object programming
//   4. strings, including interpolated strings
//   5. F# is strongly typed.  The IDE knew your types and checks on the fly
//   6. F# knows how symbols resolve: rename, goto-definition etc.

(* TASK 2 *)

// You've learned or seen all of the following: 
//   1. In this programming model, display views are
//      functional data (lists, views). 
//   2. The view is recalculated on each message in the IDE and
//      an incremental diff applied to the actual DOM.
//   3. The functional data can by computed using computed list expressions.
//      This is a super-powerful form of list comprehensions
//      and is based on a very general feature called F# computation expressions.
//      Computed list expressions are incredibly performant and versatile
//   4. You've also seen Tuples (of latitude and longitude) and used
//      helper functions to make markers.

(* TASK 3 *)

// You've learned or seen all of the following: 
//   1. async programming (async expressions) for server requests
//   2. more interpolated strings
