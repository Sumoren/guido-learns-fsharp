(* TASK 1 *)

// You've seen 
//   1. let let let let (function definitions and values)
//   2. match for pattern matching and strings
//   3. dot notation. F# supports object programming
//   4. F# is strongly typed.  The IDE knew your types and checks on the fly
//   5. strings, including interpolated strings

(* TASK 3 *)

// You've seen 
//   1. Computed functional data (lists, views). This is like a combinaton of
//      list comprehensions and functional DSLs on steroids. It is based on
//      a very general feature called F# computation expressions.
//      Computed functional lists are incredibly fast and versatile
//   2. Tuples (of latitude and longitude)

(* TASK 4 *)

// You've seen 
//   1. async programming (async expressions) for server requests
//   2. more interpolated strings
